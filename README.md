# Economies of Scale Matter: How Refueling Infrastructure Policy Affects the Viability of Alternative Fuel Trucks

This repository contains the code and data for the research paper titled *"Economies of Scale Matter: How Refueling Infrastructure Policy Affects the Viability of Alternative Fuel Trucks"*. The study investigates the economic feasibility of alternative fuel trucks, focusing on battery-electric trucks (BET) and fuel cell electric trucks (FCET), and how economies of scale in infrastructure and fleet size impact their Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) from 2025 to 2040.

## üìñ Overview
This research explores the economic viability of alternative fuel trucks, specifically BET and FCET, in the context of decarbonizing heavy-duty transport. The study emphasizes the role of economies of scale in infrastructure deployment and fleet size, highlighting how these factors influence the TCO from 2025 to 2040.

### Key Insights
- **Infrastructure and Fleet Size**: The cost-effectiveness of BET and FCET is highly dependent on the scale of infrastructure and fleet size. Larger fleets and shared refueling stations significantly reduce costs, particularly for FCET.
- **Policy Implications**: Misaligned policies can hinder decarbonization efforts. Effective policies must account for economic factors, such as infrastructure scale and energy costs, to support the transition to alternative fuel trucks.
- **Hydrogen Demand**: Aggregating hydrogen demand can lower costs and improve the feasibility of FCET, making them more competitive for long-haul operations.
